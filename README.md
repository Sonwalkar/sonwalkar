### Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I'm Akshay Sonwalkar, a Backend Developer from India 🇮🇳. I'm passionate about crafting robust solutions using various programming languages and tools. I enjoy collaborating with teams to create exceptional products and constantly seek opportunities to learn and explore new tools. When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in books 📚, grooving to music 🎵, or binge-watching the latest series and movies 🍿. Let's build something amazing together! 💻🚀
